     * The call data is the ABI encoded 4-byte function selector followed by the serialized

     * A hopper can be programmed *once* with a set of actions that are to be executed
     * for *each* initiation of the hopper's behavior.

     * WARNING: If for any reason any of a hopper's actions revert during execution the
     *          hopper could be "attacked," "bricked," or otherwise rendered inoperable 
     *          until the expiration period, depending on the trust model with the target
